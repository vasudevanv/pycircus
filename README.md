## Tutorials on computing and data analysis with Python

A set of tutorials on basic language features, scientific computing, and data analysis with Python, using Jupyter notebooks.

To open these notebooks in Jupyter, download the repository/files to a directory on your computer and from that directory run:

    $ jupyter notebook

This will open a new page in your browser with a list of the available notebooks.

The files in the repository are classified into 3 categories

#### Sketches
Files that begin with `Sketch`. These are notebooks that cover many of the basic features of the python language and key libraries used for scientific computing and data analysis. 

#### Minisketches
Files that begin with `Minisketch`. Shorter notebooks illustrating specific concepts. The content is often advanced and assumes that you have knowledge of relevant language features and library usage covered in the `Sketches`.

#### Guides
The `guides` folder contains markdown files that provide markdown guides with images/screenshoots to accomplish specific tasks.
