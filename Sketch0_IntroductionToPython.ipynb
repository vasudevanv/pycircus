    "[Python](http://www.python.org/) is a high-level, highly extensible, object-oriented programming language. Python is open source, cross-platform (runs on Windows / Mac OS X / Linux), immensely flexible, and extremely easy to use and learn. \n",
    "Python is an interpreted language, i.e., code is read and executed on a line-by-line basis. Some of the key features, advantages and disadvantages are listed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key features:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Interpreted language\n",
    "* Clean and easy-to-read code construct \n",
    "* Intuitive syntax\n",
    "* Fewer lines of code = Fewer bugs\n",
    "* dynamically typed\n",
    "* automatic memory management\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Ease of programming - minimizing the time for development, debugging and maintainence \n",
    "* Modular and object-oriented programming with a good system for packaging and re-use of code. This often results in more transparent, maintainable and bug-free code.\n",
    "* Documentation tightly integrated with the code.\n",
    "* Availability of a large collection of libraries/add-on packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Being an interpreted language, execution of python code is slower compared to compiled languages, such as C/C++ or Fortran.\n"

    "## Installing Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Most linux distributions and Apple's Mac OS X come with python installed. Currently this is version 2.7. Installers for Python 3.3 are available through the package management program on these operating systems. Windows on the other hand lacks a good packaging system, so the easiest way to setup a Python environment is to install a pre-packaged distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "The python software foundation distributes a python installer for all platforms and you can install that. For installing addition libraries you can use python's built-in package management system ``pip``. While this is perfectly reasonable, there is a simpler way to install python and all the commonly used python packages such as numpy and scipy via pre-packaged scientific python distributions. These pre-packaged distributions are usually cross-platform. The most popular and preferred distribution is [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads.html) by  Continuum Analytics'. It is cross-platform, has a permissive license, and includes the awesome conda package manager that makes installing additional packages and managing virtual development environments really easy. \n",
    "\n",
    "We normally use *miniconda*, as it's lightweight and provides everything we need to simplify dealing with different environments and managing dependencies. You can download miniconda installer for your OS [here](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html). The installation instructions are available on the conda website and are self-explanatory.\n",
    "\n",
    "I personally keep my linux/mac installation of `miniconda` at `/home/username/Applications/anaconda` and my windows installation at `C:\\Users\\username\\Software\\anaconda`. I also add these paths (and any related subdirectories) to the `PATH` environment variable. \n",

    "\n",
    "#### Why use virtual environments? \n",
    "If python packages are installed system-wide, there could potentially be many problems such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Conflicts with system dependencies, e.g., on Linux, system scripts may depend on specific version of a package. On the other side our Python application may require different version of the same package.\n",
    "- Conflicting dependencies across different projects/applications\n",
    "- Tedious testing of a single project/application against different Python versions or different versions of a specific package (would include upgrading/downgrading packages each time testing is performed)\n",
